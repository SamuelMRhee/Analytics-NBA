Personal Project Playing with different statistical analyses of NBA data
Most of this data is derived from fivethirtyeight's "nba player advanced metrics", downloaded December 5th, 2020.
In future iterations of this project, I'd like to find a way to update my metrics in real time as fivethirtyeight updates
  their data.
annual-efficiency-by-team.csv is a first attempt at tracking efficiency stats across multiple seasons for individual franchises.
"weighted effiency" is a measure using True Shooting %, weighted by MPG. Only players who averaged over 5 minutes per game in a 
  season were counted. These efficiency measures were totaled for a franchise for the whole season.
